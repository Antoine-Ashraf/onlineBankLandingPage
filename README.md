# Online Bank Landing Page
This code represents a JavaScript implementation of various interactive web functionalities. It begins with selecting multiple DOM elements like modals, buttons, navigation, and sections, which are used for implementing dynamic behaviors. The code includes features such as opening and closing a modal window, smooth scrolling to sections upon clicking buttons or navigation links, and tabbed content navigation where only one tab's content is visible at a time. Additional functionalities include sticky navigation achieved using the Intersection Observer API, revealing elements as they scroll into view, and lazy-loading images for performance optimization. Finally, a slider component is implemented to allow users to navigate through slides using buttons, providing an interactive user experience.
